## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation Notes**

### API Integration Patterns
```typescript
// Use React Query for all API calls
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['worlds', worldId],
  queryFn: () => worldsAPI.get(worldId),
})

// Implement optimistic updates
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: contentAPI.create,
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['content'])
  }
})
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Feature-based component organization
src/
  components/
    content/          # Content-specific components
    search/           # Search and discovery
    timeline/         # Timeline and chronology
    collaboration/    # Real-time features
  pages/
    content/          # Content management pages
    search/           # Search interface pages
    timeline/         # Timeline view pages
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Use React Query for server state
// Use React Context for UI state
// Use local state for form state
```
