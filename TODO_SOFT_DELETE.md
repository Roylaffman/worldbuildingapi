# 🗑️ Soft Delete Implementation TODO

## 🚨 **Critical Issues to Fix**

### **Database Migration Required**
- **Error**: `no such column: collab_character.is_deleted`
- **Cause**: Added soft delete fields to models but haven't run migration
- **Fix**: Run the migration to add the new database columns

```bash
# Apply the soft delete migration
python manage.py migrate collab 0002_add_soft_delete
```

### **Missing Character Form**
- **Issue**: CreateCharacterForm.tsx is missing
- **Impact**: Character creation fails with import error
- **Status**: Needs to be created

## 📋 **Implementation Steps**

### **1. Database Setup (URGENT)**
```bash
# Run migration to add soft delete columns
python manage.py migrate collab 0002_add_soft_delete

# Verify migration applied
python manage.py showmigrations collab
```

### **2. Missing Form Components**
- [ ] Create `CreateCharacterForm.tsx` (missing)
- [x] Create `CreatePageForm.tsx` (done)
- [x] Create `CreateStoryForm.tsx` (done) 
- [x] Create `CreateEssayForm.tsx` (done)

### **3. Test Soft Delete System**
- [ ] Test soft delete functionality
- [ ] Test restore functionality  
- [ ] Test management commands
- [ ] Verify admin interface works

### **4. Frontend Integration**
- [ ] Add "Delete" buttons to content views
- [ ] Add "Restore" functionality for admins
- [ ] Update content lists to exclude soft-deleted items
- [ ] Add "Show Deleted" toggle for admins

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes Needed**

### **Immediate (Before Testing)**
1. **Run migration**: `python manage.py migrate collab 0002_add_soft_delete`
2. **Create missing character form**
3. **Test character creation**

### **Short Term (This Week)**
1. Add delete buttons to content detail pages
2. Test soft delete commands
3. Verify cache invalidation works properly

### **Long Term (Future)**
1. Add admin interface for managing deleted content
2. Set up automated cleanup cron job
3. Add user notifications for restored content

## 🎯 **Expected Benefits After Implementation**

### **For Users**
- ✅ Accidental deletions can be undone
- ✅ Content remains immutable during normal use
- ✅ Better user experience with "undo" functionality

### **For Administrators**  
- ✅ Database growth is controlled
- ✅ Can recover accidentally deleted content
- ✅ Automated cleanup of truly unused content

### **For System**
- ✅ Maintains data integrity
- ✅ Prevents infinite database growth
- ✅ Preserves collaborative links and references

## 🚨 **Current Status**

- **Models**: ✅ Updated with soft delete fields
- **Migration**: ❌ **NEEDS TO BE RUN** 
- **Management Commands**: ✅ Created
- **Frontend Forms**: ⚠️ **Missing CreateCharacterForm**
- **Admin Interface**: ✅ Created
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete

## 🔥 **Next Actions**

1. **URGENT**: Run `python manage.py migrate collab 0002_add_soft_delete`
2. **HIGH**: Create missing `CreateCharacterForm.tsx`
3. **MEDIUM**: Test character creation workflow
4. **LOW**: Add delete buttons to frontend

**Note**: The soft delete system is ready but needs the database migration to be applied before it will work properly!
