## Detailed Issue Analysis

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

#### 1. Character Model Validation Errors
**Issue**: Character creation fails due to missing required fields
```
ValidationError: {'personality_traits': ['This field cannot be blank.'], 'relationships': ['This field cannot be blank.']}
```
**Impact**: Blocks character-related functionality testing
**Root Cause**: Model validation requires non-empty lists for JSON fields
**Fix Required**: Update model validation or test data

#### 2. Story Model Validation Errors
**Issue**: Story creation fails due to missing required main_characters field
```
ValidationError: {'main_characters': ['This field cannot be blank.']}
```
**Impact**: Blocks story-related functionality testing
**Root Cause**: Model validation requires non-empty main_characters list
**Fix Required**: Update model validation or test data

#### 3. API Data Format Issues
**Issue**: Tests fail when sending complex data (dictionaries) without JSON format
```
AssertionError: Test data contained a dictionary value for key 'relationships', but multipart uploads do not support nested data.
```
**Impact**: API testing for complex content types
**Root Cause**: Test client defaults to multipart form data
**Fix Required**: Specify `format='json'` in test requests

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Content Validation Length Requirements
**Issue**: Some tests fail due to content length validation (10 character minimum)
```
ContentValidationError: Content body must be at least 10 characters long
```
**Impact**: Test data doesn't meet validation requirements
**Root Cause**: Test content too short
**Fix Required**: Update test data to meet validation requirements

#### 5. JWT Token Verification Endpoint
**Issue**: Token verification returns 401 instead of 200
**Impact**: JWT token validation testing
**Root Cause**: Possible endpoint configuration or token format issue
**Fix Required**: Investigate JWT token verification implementation

#### 6. User Registration Server Error
**Issue**: User registration returns 500 instead of 201
**Impact**: User registration testing
**Root Cause**: Server-side error during registration
**Fix Required**: Debug registration endpoint implementation

### Low Priority Issues

#### 7. Time Zone Warnings
**Issue**: Multiple warnings about naive datetime objects
```
RuntimeWarning: DateTimeField received a naive datetime while time zone support is active
```
**Impact**: Test output noise, potential timezone issues
**Root Cause**: Test data creation without timezone awareness
**Fix Required**: Use timezone-aware datetime objects in tests

#### 8. Attribution Format Expectations
**Issue**: Test expects "Test User" but gets "testuser" in attribution
**Impact**: Attribution display testing
**Root Cause**: User display name vs username in attribution
**Fix Required**: Update test expectations or attribution logic
