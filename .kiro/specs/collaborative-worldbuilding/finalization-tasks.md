# Finalization Tasks - Collaborative Worldbuilding Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining tasks to finalize the Collaborative Worldbuilding Platform before deployment. Based on the review of the current implementation, the backend is 95% complete with comprehensive API endpoints, authentication, and testing. The frontend has a solid foundation but needs completion of core functionality and API integration.

- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with user profiles
- **Testing**: 223 tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs and guides
- **Soft Delete System**: Implemented with management commands
- **Admin Interface**: Custom admin with soft delete support

### ✅ Completed (Frontend - 40%)
- **Project Setup**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
- **Authentication Pages**: Login/Register with validation
- **Core Components**: UI components and layout
- **Routing**: Protected routes and navigation
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces

### ❌ Missing (High Priority)
- **API Integration**: Frontend not connected to backend
- **Content Management**: Create/view content forms missing
- **World Detail Pages**: Placeholder implementations
- **Search Interface**: Not implemented
- **Timeline View**: Not implemented
