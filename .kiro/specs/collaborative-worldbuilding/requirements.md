# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A collaborative worldbuilding Django application that enables multiple users to contribute to shared fictional worlds through interconnected content entries. The system maintains chronological integrity through timestamping and prevents retconning to ensure consistent world evolution. Users can create various types of content including wiki entries,comic storyboards, images, essays, short stories, and character profiles, all stored in a PostgreSQL database with JWT authentication and RESTful API access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a worldbuilder, I want to register and authenticate with the system, so that I can contribute to collaborative worlds and have my contributions tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with unique credentials
2. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL issue a JWT access token for API authentication
3. WHEN a user's JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh mechanism to maintain session continuity
4. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate their JWT token before allowing access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a worldbuilder, I want to create and manage worlds, so that I can establish collaborative spaces for storytelling projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates a world THEN the system SHALL store the world with a unique identifier, title, description, and creation timestamp
2. WHEN a user views available worlds THEN the system SHALL display all worlds with their basic information and contributor counts
3. WHEN a user accesses a specific world THEN the system SHALL show all associated content entries organized by type and creation date
4. IF a user is the world creator THEN the system SHALL allow them to update world metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want to create different types of content entries within a world, so that I can build rich, interconnected worldbuilding content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a wiki entry THEN the system SHALL store it with title, content, tags, and automatic timestamp
2. WHEN a user creates an essay THEN the system SHALL store it with title, content, tags, and automatic timestamp  
3. WHEN a user creates a character profile THEN the system SHALL store it with name, description, attributes, and automatic timestamp
4. WHEN a user creates a short story THEN the system SHALL store it with title, content, tags, and automatic timestamp
5. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL store it with caption, description, tags, and automatic timestamp
6. WHEN any content is created THEN the system SHALL assign it a permanent timestamp that cannot be modified

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want to link and reference other content entries, so that I can create an interconnected web of worldbuilding information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates content THEN the system SHALL allow them to tag it with relevant keywords
2. WHEN a user views content THEN the system SHALL display all associated tags as clickable links
3. WHEN a user clicks a tag THEN the system SHALL show all content entries with that tag
4. WHEN a user creates content THEN the system SHALL allow them to reference other entries by title or ID
5. WHEN content references another entry THEN the system SHALL create bidirectional links between the entries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a worldbuilder, I want the system to prevent retconning, so that the world maintains consistency and chronological integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is created THEN the system SHALL make it immutable and prevent any modifications to existing content
2. WHEN a user attempts to edit existing content THEN the system SHALL reject the request and suggest creating new content instead
3. WHEN content is created THEN the system SHALL permanently record the author and creation timestamp
4. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL always show entries in chronological order of creation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want to view content chronologically and by relationships, so that I can understand the world's development and find related information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a world THEN the system SHALL provide a chronological timeline of all content creation
2. WHEN a user views content THEN the system SHALL display related entries based on tags and references
3. WHEN a user searches within a world THEN the system SHALL return results ranked by relevance and recency
4. WHEN a user filters content THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by content type, author, tags, and date ranges

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to integrate with PostgreSQL and provide RESTful APIs, so that it can scale and integrate with other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to PostgreSQL database with proper connection pooling
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond with proper JSON formatting and HTTP status codes
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle transactions properly and maintain data integrity
4. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL allow configured frontend domains to access the API
5. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them appropriately and return meaningful error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want to collaborate respectfully with others, so that the worldbuilding experience remains positive and productive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates content THEN the system SHALL clearly attribute it to the author with timestamp
2. WHEN multiple users contribute to a world THEN the system SHALL track all contributions separately
3. WHEN a user views content THEN the system SHALL display the author and creation date prominently
4. WHEN content builds upon existing entries THEN the system SHALL encourage referencing and linking to source
